## 💫 Challenge
1. **Define question:** Lack of domain knowledge makes our's big question not completely logical but still have holes, the big question is also too broad to analyze.

    **Solution:** Get suggestions from seniors and learn from experience.

2. **Teamwork:** Working together for the first time, team members do not have a good relationship in communication and exchange of ideas, making the analysis not linked well.

    **Solution:** Should discuss at the end of the working day what has been done, talk about your ideas so that other members can gradually grasp and can help each other correct mistakes in logic or coding.
